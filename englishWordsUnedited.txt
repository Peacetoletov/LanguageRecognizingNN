//Robinson Crusoe
CHAPTER I - START IN LIFE
I WAS born in the year 1632, in the city of York, of a
good family, though not of that country, my father being a
foreigner of Bremen, who settled first at Hull. He got a
good estate by merchandise, and leaving off his trade, lived
afterwards at York, from whence he had married my
mother, whose relations were named Robinson, a very
good family in that country, and from whom I was called
Robinson Kreutznaer; but, by the usual corruption of
words in England, we are now called - nay we call
ourselves and write our name - Crusoe; and so my
companions always called me.
I had two elder brothers, one of whom was lieutenantcolonel
to an English regiment of foot in Flanders,
formerly commanded by the famous Colonel Lockhart,
and was killed at the battle near Dunkirk against the
Spaniards. What became of my second brother I never
knew, any more than my father or mother knew what
became of me.
Being the third son of the family and not bred to any
trade, my head began to be filled very early with rambling
thoughts. My father, who was very ancient, had given me
Robinson Crusoe
3 of 487
a competent share of learning, as far as house-education
and a country free school generally go, and designed me
for the law; but I would be satisfied with nothing but
going to sea; and my inclination to this led me so strongly
against the will, nay, the commands of my father, and
against all the entreaties and persuasions of my mother and
other friends, that there seemed to be something fatal in
that propensity of nature, tending directly to the life of
misery which was to befall me.
My father, a wise and grave man, gave me serious and
excellent counsel against what he foresaw was my design.
He called me one morning into his chamber, where he
was confined by the gout, and expostulated very warmly
with me upon this subject. He asked me what reasons,
more than a mere wandering inclination, I had for leaving
father’s house and my native country, where I might be
well introduced, and had a prospect of raising my fortune
by application and industry, with a life of ease and
pleasure. He told me it was men of desperate fortunes on
one hand, or of aspiring, superior fortunes on the other,
who went abroad upon adventures, to rise by enterprise,
and make themselves famous in undertakings of a nature
out of the common road; that these things were all either
too far above me or too far below me; that mine was the
Robinson Crusoe
4 of 487
middle state, or what might be called the upper station of
low life, which he had found, by long experience, was the
best state in the world, the most suited to human
happiness, not exposed to the miseries and hardships, the
labour and sufferings of the mechanic part of mankind,
and not embarrassed with the pride, luxury, ambition, and
envy of the upper part of mankind. He told me I might
judge of the happiness of this state by this one thing - viz.
that this was the state of life which all other people envied;
that kings have frequently lamented the miserable
consequence of being born to great things, and wished
they had been placed in the middle of the two extremes,
between the mean and the great; that the wise man gave
his testimony to this, as the standard of felicity, when he
prayed to have neither poverty nor riches.
He bade me observe it, and I should always find that
the calamities of life were shared among the upper and
lower part of mankind, but that the middle station had the
fewest disasters, and was not exposed to so many
vicissitudes as the higher or lower part of mankind; nay,
they were not subjected to so many distempers and
uneasinesses, either of body or mind, as those were who,
by vicious living, luxury, and extravagances on the one
hand, or by hard labour, want of necessaries, and mean or
Robinson Crusoe
5 of 487
insufficient diet on the other hand, bring distemper upon
themselves by the natural consequences of their way of
living; that the middle station of life was calculated for all
kind of virtue and all kind of enjoyments; that peace and
plenty were the handmaids of a middle fortune; that
temperance, moderation, quietness, health, society, all
agreeable diversions, and all desirable pleasures, were the
blessings attending the middle station of life; that this way
men went silently and smoothly through the world, and
comfortably out of it, not embarrassed with the labours of
the hands or of the head, not sold to a life of slavery for
daily bread, nor harassed with perplexed circumstances,
which rob the soul of peace and the body of rest, nor
enraged with the passion of envy, or the secret burning
lust of ambition for great things; but, in easy
circumstances, sliding gently through the world, and
sensibly tasting the sweets of living, without the bitter;
feeling that they are happy, and learning by every day’s
experience to know it more sensibly,
After this he pressed me earnestly, and in the most
affectionate manner, not to play the young man, nor to
precipitate myself into miseries which nature, and the
station of life I was born in, seemed to have provided
against; that I was under no necessity of seeking my bread;
Robinson Crusoe
6 of 487
that he would do well for me, and endeavour to enter me
fairly into the station of life which he had just been
recommending to me; and that if I was not very easy and
happy in the world, it must be my mere fate or fault that
must hinder it; and that he should have nothing to answer
for, having thus discharged his duty in warning me against
measures which he knew would be to my hurt; in a word,
that as he would do very kind things for me if I would stay
and settle at home as he directed, so he would not have so
much hand in my misfortunes as to give me any
encouragement to go away; and to close all, he told me I
had my elder brother for an example, to whom he had
used the same earnest persuasions to keep him from going
into the Low Country wars, but could not prevail, his
young desires prompting him to run into the army, where
he was killed; and though he said he would not cease to
pray for me, yet he would venture to say to me, that if I
did take this foolish step, God would not bless me, and I
should have leisure hereafter to reflect upon having
neglected his counsel when there might be none to assist
in my recovery.
I observed in this last part of his discourse, which was
truly prophetic, though I suppose my father did not know
it to be so himself - I say, I observed the tears run down
his face very plentifully, especially when he spoke of my
brother who was killed: and that when he spoke of my
having leisure to repent, and none to assist me, he was so
moved that he broke off the discourse, and told me his
heart was so full he could say no more to me.
I was sincerely affected with this discourse, and, indeed,
who could be otherwise? and I resolved not to think of
going abroad any more, but to settle at home according to
my father’s desire. But alas! a few days wore it all off; and,
in short, to prevent any of my father’s further
importunities, in a few weeks after I resolved to run quite
away from him. However, I did not act quite so hastily as
the first heat of my resolution prompted; but I took my
mother at a time when I thought her a little more pleasant
than ordinary, and told her that my thoughts were so
entirely bent upon seeing the world that I should never
settle to anything with resolution enough to go through
with it, and my father had better give me his consent than
force me to go without it; that I was now eighteen years
old, which was too late to go apprentice to a trade or clerk
to an attorney; that I was sure if I did I should never serve
out my time, but I should certainly run away from my
master before my time was out, and go to sea; and if she
would speak to my father to let me go one voyage abroad,
Robinson Crusoe
8 of 487
if I came home again, and did not like it, I would go no
more; and I would promise, by a double diligence, to
recover the time that I had lost.
This put my mother into a great passion; she told me
she knew it would be to no purpose to speak to my father
upon any such subject; that he knew too well what was
my interest to give his consent to anything so much for
my hurt; and that she wondered how I could think of any
such thing after the discourse I had had with my father,
and such kind and tender expressions as she knew my
father had used to me; and that, in short, if I would ruin
myself, there was no help for me; but I might depend I
should never have their consent to it; that for her part she
would not have so much hand in my destruction; and I
should never have it to say that my mother was willing
when my father was not.
Though my mother refused to move it to my father,
yet I heard afterwards that she reported all the discourse to
him, and that my father, after showing a great concern at
it, said to her, with a sigh, ‘That boy might be happy if he
would stay at home; but if he goes abroad, he will be the
most miserable wretch that ever was born: I can give no
consent to it.’

It was not till almost a year after this that I broke loose,
though, in the meantime, I continued obstinately deaf to
all proposals of settling to business, and frequently
expostulated with my father and mother about their being
so positively determined against what they knew my
inclinations prompted me to. But being one day at Hull,
where I went casually, and without any purpose of making
an elopement at that time; but, I say, being there, and one
of my companions being about to sail to London in his
father’s ship, and prompting me to go with them with the
common allurement of seafaring men, that it should cost
me nothing for my passage, I consulted neither father nor
mother any more, nor so much as sent them word of it;
but leaving them to hear of it as they might, without
asking God’s blessing or my father’s, without any
consideration of circumstances or consequences, and in an
ill hour, God knows, on the 1st of September 1651, I
went on board a ship bound for London. Never any
young adventurer’s misfortunes, I believe, began sooner,
or continued longer than mine. The ship was no sooner
out of the Humber than the wind began to blow and the
sea to rise in a most frightful manner; and, as I had never
been at sea before, I was most inexpressibly sick in body
and terrified in mind. I began now seriously to reflect
Robinson Crusoe
10 of 487
upon what I had done, and how justly I was overtaken by
the judgment of Heaven for my wicked leaving my
father’s house, and abandoning my duty. All the good
counsels of my parents, my father’s tears and my mother’s
entreaties, came now fresh into my mind; and my
conscience, which was not yet come to the pitch of
hardness to which it has since, reproached me with the
contempt of advice, and the breach of my duty to God
and my father.
All this while the storm increased, and the sea went
very high, though nothing like what I have seen many
times since; no, nor what I saw a few days after; but it was
enough to affect me then, who was but a young sailor, and
had never known anything of the matter. I expected every
wave would have swallowed us up, and that every time
the ship fell down, as I thought it did, in the trough or
hollow of the sea, we should never rise more; in this
agony of mind, I made many vows and resolutions that if
it would please God to spare my life in this one voyage, if
ever I got once my foot upon dry land again, I would go
directly home to my father, and never set it into a ship
again while I lived; that I would take his advice, and never
run myself into such miseries as these any more. Now I
saw plainly the goodness of his observations about the

BEEF AND MUTTON RECIPES
Note.—To the housewife pretty nearly at the end
of her resources, no less than to the hungry folk
for whom she caters, several of the following suggestions
will come with all the force of novelty. I have divided them, for purposes of the cook's
convenience, into methods of treating hot meat and
cold. We are only too apt to become stale and
monotonous in our repetition, month by month and
year by year, of certain too-familiar joints and
rechauffes. But anything which can obUterate the
memory of the horrid word " hash," should be as desirable as it is rare. Where stews are concerned
(whether of fresh or cooked meat), I would like to remind the reader that anything baked iq earthen- ware is infinitely better cooked and better flavoured
than it can ever be in a metal vessel. The earthen- ware retains and imparts heat and flavour in a most
marvellous manner. And indeed, speaking generally,
I would say, steer clear of metal whenever and
wherever you can, making use of wood and earthen- ware alone. Also, it is to be observed, that careful
basting (too frequently ignored) is an essential
point, not only in the cooking, but in the appearance
of any baked or roasted meat.

1.1 FEATURES OF THE ENGLISH LEGAL
SYSTEM
 The English legal system is unlike that of any other
European country. An outline knowledge of the
features which make the English system so distinct is
essential to an understanding of English law and the
English legal process.
1.1.1 Antiquity and continuity
 English law has evolved, without any major upheaval or
interruption, over many hundreds of years. The last successful
invasion of England occurred in 1066, when King
William and his Normans conquered the country. King
William did not impose Norman law on the conquered
Anglo-Saxons, but allowed them to keep their own laws.
These laws were not uniform throughout the kingdom.
Anglo-Saxon law was based on custom and in different
parts of the country different customs prevailed.
 In the second half of the twelfth century King Henry
II introduced a central administration for the law and
began the process of applying one set of legal rules, ‘the
common law’, throughout England. Since that time,
English law has evolved piecemeal. For this reason the
English legal system retains a number of peculiarities and
anomalies which find their origins in mediaeval England.
 The world history of the past few hundred years
has been a litany of revolution and conquest. The new
rulers of a country tend to start afresh with the law.
In the Soviet Union the communists introduced Soviet
law, in France Napoleon introduced the Napoleonic
code, in the United States the founding fathers wrote
the American Constitution. But England is one of
the very few countries to have survived the last nine
hundred years with no lasting revolution from within
or foreign conquest from abroad. Some English laws
and legal practices have evolved continuously since

upheaval, but even that was not a fresh beginning
for the law.
 English law does not become inoperative merely
because of the passage of time. When we study the
law of contract we shall see that two ancient cases,
Pinnel’s Case (1602) 5 Co Rep 117a and Lampleigh v
Brathwaite (1615) Hob 105, are still important precedents.
Although these cases have been refined and
developed by subsequent cases, there would be no
reason why a modern lawyer should not cite them
in court. In the same way, statutes remain in force
indefinitely or until they are repealed. A statute
loses none of its authority merely because it has
lain dormant for many years. In R v Duncan [1944]
KB 713, for example, a defendant was convicted of
fortune-telling under the Witchcraft Act 1735, even
though the statute had long since fallen into disuse.
 Occasionally a litigant springs a major surprise
by invoking an ancient law. In 1818 the defendant
in Ashford v Thornton (1818) 1 B & A 405, claimed
the right to have an appeal against his conviction for
murder settled by battle. Trial by battle had been a
method of resolving disputes shortly after the Norman
Conquest but had fallen into disuse before the end
of the thirteenth century. In Ashford v Thornton ,
the offer of trial by battle was declined and so the
defendant was discharged. The Appeals of Murder Act
1819 was hurriedly passed. Until Parliament passed
this Act trial by battle still existed as a possible means
of settling some types of legal disputes.
1.1.2 Absence of a legal code
 In most European countries the law has been codified.
This means that the whole of the law on a particular
subject, for example the law of property, can be found
in one document or code. Some such codes merely
provide a framework for the law, others attempt to
provide a complete statement of the law. As we shall
see, the bulk of English law has been made by judges
in individual cases. Rules of law made by senior judges
must be followed in later cases. In the majority of
cases brought before an English court a lawyer who is
trying to establish a legal principle will cite
earlier cases to prove that the principle exists and
that it should be applied in the current case. Often a
statute, an Act of Parliament, will provide the main
legal rules applicable to a particular case. A statute
ranks higher as a source of law than the previous
decision of any court. But even where a statute does
apply to a particular case, the court is likely to be
guided as to the meaning of the statute by earlier cases
which have considered its meaning.
 In general, the important cases on a particular area
of law are not reported in one special volume of law
reports devoted to a particular area of law, such as
the law of contract. (There are exceptions, specialist
law reports can be found on some areas of law such
as employment law or road traffic law. The system of
law reporting is examined in the following chapter at
2.9.) Generally, cases are reported as they are decided
and are therefore to be found in the law report volume
devoted to the year in which the case was decided.
As lawyers and students are only too well aware, it
can be very difficult to find all the cases relevant to a
particular legal issue.
 Occasionally, Parliament codifies an area of law
with a statute such as the Partnership Act 1890.
Such an Act aims to take all the relevant case law
on a particular subject and to codify it into one
comprehensible statute. The Law Commission, an
important law reform institution set up in 1965, has
the codification of appropriate areas of law as one
of its objects. But as we shall see, the vast majority
of English law remains uncodified. Nor does Britain
have a written constitution, as most other democratic
countries have.
1.1.3 The law-making role of the judges
 In most European countries the judges interpret the
legal code. In doing this they do not themselves
deliberately set out to create law. Later in this chapter,
when we study the doctrine of judicial precedent, we
shall see that the English courts are arranged in an
hierarchical structure and that courts lower down the
hierarchy must follow the previous decisions of courts
which are higher up. Senior English judges therefore
have a dual role. First, they interpret the existing
law, which is to be found in legislation and previous
decisions of higher ranking courts. Second, they create
the law by making legal principles which courts lower
down the hierarchy are bound to follow.
1.1.4 Importance of procedure
 In the Middle Ages a legal right could only be enforced
by means of a writ (an order signed by the King,
requiring a defendant to appear in court to answer the
claim being made). There were few types of writ and,
M01_MACI2747_06_SE_C01.indd 2 01_MACI2747_06_SE_C01.indd 2 2/16/12 9:59 AM /16/12 9:59 AM

1.1 Features of the English legal system 3
if a claim could not be brought within the confines
of one of the writs then no remedy was available.
To some extent lawyers were people who knew the
procedure of obtaining a remedy, rather than people
who knew the substantive principles of the law. A
person with a perfectly just claim would need a lawyer
to fit the claim within the procedures of one of the
writs. If the correct procedure was not rigidly adhered
to, then the claim would fail, even if the substance of
the claim was perfectly valid. To some extent this is
still true today. If a litigant fails to follow the correct
procedure it is possible that his claim will be struck
out. Recent reforms of the judicial process, which we
consider in Chapter 2 , have attempted to reduce the
importance of procedure. However, in cases which
involve a substantial claim there is no doubt that
procedure remains very important.
1.1.5 Absence of Roman law
 The Romans occupied England from 55 BC to AD 430.
Roman law was extremely sophisticated by the standards
of its day. The other European countries which
were part of the Roman Empire have retained elements
of Roman law. But English law has almost
no direct Roman law influence, although Roman
law is still taught as an academic subject at some
English universities and some areas of law have been
indirectly based on Roman law concepts. Scotland
was not conquered by the Romans, but Scots law has
more of a Roman law influence than English law.
This influence has been brought about by the
traditional alliance of France and Scotland. During
the Renaissance, when the modern European world
began to develop, Scotland and Continental Europe
saw a revival of interest in Roman law. This interest
was largely absent in England.
1.1.6 The adversarial system of trial
 The English system of trial is adversarial. This means
that the lawyers on either side are adversaries, who
‘fight’ each other in trying to win judgment for their
client. The judge supervises the battle between the
lawyers, but does not take part. Today the battle is
metaphoric, one party’s lawyers try to establish that
there is a case, the other party’s lawyers deny this by
whatever means permissible. In the early Middle Ages
the battle could be real enough, as certain types of
dispute were resolved with a Trial by Battle. In such
a trial the parties would fight each other, both armed
with a leather shield and a staff and it was thought
that God would grant victory to the righteous litigant.
If either of the parties was disabled, too young or too
old, he could hire a champion to fight for him. This
was no doubt considerably more entertaining than
a modern trial, but eventually it came to be realised
that it was not the best way to achieve justice. Lawyers
therefore replaced the champions. But the idea of a
battle survived and a trial is still a battle between the
lawyers, even if the shields and staffs have given way
to witnesses and precedents.
 Most other countries have an inquisitorial system
of criminal procedure where the judge is the inquisitor,
determined to discover the truth. A French investigating
judge (juge d’instruction), for example, has
enormous powers. He takes over the investigation
of a criminal case from the police. He can interrogate
whoever he wishes. He can compel witnesses to
give evidence and can surprise witnesses with other
witnesses, hoping that the confrontation will point
the finger of guilt. In a civil case, too, a French judge
will take a much more interventionist approach than
an English judge and it is the judge, rather than the
lawyers, who manages, the case.
 When a French case reaches court it is often all but
decided. By contrast, no one can ever be certain of the
outcome of an English trial. The lawyers will fight for
their clients on the day and either side might win. The
judge should be disinterested in the outcome, merely
ensuring that the lawyers fight by the rules. However,
since the introduction of the Civil Procedure Rules in
1999 civil trials have become less adversarial and the
judge manages the case to some extent.
 An important aspect of the adversarial system of
trial is that it is the task of the lawyers to bring the
relevant legal rules to the attention of the court. If a
lawyer in court makes a perfectly true statement of
law, such as the statement that all goods sold in the
course of business must be of satisfactory quality,
he must provide authority for this statement. This
means that the lawyer must quote the case, or in this
instance the statute, which made the law. Similarly,
students must cite authorities. At all levels of study, a
statement of law with no authority to back it up is not
regarded highly.
 Two other features of the English legal system,
both of which are examined in Chapter 2 , are worth
mentioning here. First, the legal profession is divided,
lawyers being either barristers or solicitors. Second, in
M01_MACI2747_06_SE_C01.indd 3 01_MACI2747_06_SE_C01.indd 3 2/16/12 9:59 AM /16/12 9:59 AM

4 Chapter 1 The legal system
almost all criminal trials the innocence or guilt of the
accused is decided by laymen, rather than by lawyers or
judges. If the accused is tried in the Crown Court it will
be a jury who decides whether the accused is guilty. If
the crime is tried in the magistrates’ court it is generally
a bench of lay magistrates who make this decision.
 Commonwealth and former Commonwealth
countries, such as Australia, Canada and New Zealand,
have retained the adversarial system of trial and most
other features of the English legal system. In the
United States of America trials are adversarial and
some features of the English legal system have been
retained. As we shall see both in this chapter and
in Chapter 2 , there is now considerable pressure to
change many of the traditional features of the English
legal system, which are increasingly perceived to be
ill-suited to the needs of the twenty-first century.
1.2 CLASSIFICATION OF ENGLISH LAW
 English law can be classified in three main ways:
as public law or private law; as common law or
equity; or as civil law or criminal law. Each of these
classifications is worth considering in some detail. It
is also worth considering the distinction between law
and fact .
1.2.1 Public law and private law
 Public law is concerned with decisions made by
bodies which are governmental in nature. Private law
is concerned with the legal relationships of individual
citizens. Criminal law, for example, is regarded as public
law. Citizens are prosecuted by the State. The law
of contract, on the other hand, is private law. A person
who sues for breach of contract acts as one individual
suing another individual. The State provides a framework
for such a dispute to be resolved. That is to say, it
provides the courts and the judges, but it plays no part
in bringing or defending the action.
 There are three main areas of public law.
Constitutional law is concerned with the workings of
the British Constitution, deciding such matters as the
powers of Government Ministers. Criminal law makes
certain types of behaviour criminal offences, giving
the State the power to prosecute and punish those
who commit such offences. Administrative law deals
with disputes between citizens and Government agencies,
such as the Department for Work and Pensions.
 Private law is also called civil law and can be
broadly broken down into five main areas: contract,
tort, property, trusts and family law.
1.2.2 Common law and equity
 The term common law is used in three distinct senses.
First, it is used to distinguish countries which have
adopted the features of the English legal system from
those countries which have not. The features of the
English legal system were explained at the beginning
of this chapter. Countries which adopt these features
are said to have a common law system. Countries
which adopt the central European system are said to
have a civil law system. Second, the term common
law denotes that body of law which was made by the
judges in the King’s (or Queen’s) courts, rather than
the body of law made by the judges in the courts of
equity. Third, common law means judge-made law as
distinct from statute law.
 It is, perhaps, unfortunate that the term common
law is used in three different ways. However, the
context in which the term is used will generally make
apparent the sense in which the term is used. Here
we are considering the difference between the law
made by the judges in the King’s courts and the law
made by the judges in the courts of equity. To understand
this distinction and to understand the meaning
of equity, we must know something of the historical
development of the law.
 A hundred years after the Norman Conquest, Henry
II began the process of applying one set of legal rules,
the common law, throughout the country. The King’s
representatives travelled from London to the provinces,
checking on the procedures in the local courts.
Gradually these representatives became judges rather
than administrators. When they arrived they would
try the cases which had been waiting for them (a
system which survived into the 1970s). The decisions
of these first travelling judges began to be recorded.
Subsequent judges followed the earlier decisions, in
order to provide a uniform system of law. Gradually
one set of legal rules became common to the whole
country and it therefore became known as the common
law.
 The common law grew to have several defects.
First, legal actions could only be commenced through
the issuing of a writ. By the middle of the thirteenth
century there were around 50 writs, to cover different
types of cases. In the reign of Henry III, after political

PREFACE.
ONCE more I come before the public with a work on the
history of a nation which is not mine by birth.
It is the ambition of all nations which enjoy a literary
culture to possess a harmonious and vivid narrative of their
own past history. And it is of inestimable value to any
people to obtain such a narrative, which shall comprehend
all epochs, be truc to fact and, while resting on thorough
research, yet be attractive to the reader ; for only by this aid
can the nation attain to a pcrfect self-consciousness, and
feeling the pulsation of its life throughout the story, become
fully acquainted with its own origin and growth and character.
But we may doubt whether up to this time worlts of such
an import and compass have ever been produced, and even
whether they can be produced. For who could apply critical
research, such as the progress of study now renders necessary,
to the mass of materials already collected, without being lost
in its immensity? Who again could possess the vivid susceptibility
requisite for doing justice to the several epochs, for
appreciating the actions, the modes of thought, and the moral
standard of each of them, and for understanding their relations
to universal history? We must be content in this department,
as well as in others, if we can but approximate to the ideal we

set up. The best-written histories will be accounted the
best.
- When then an author undertakes to make the past life of a
foreign nation the object of a comprehensive literary work, he
will not think of writing its history as a nation in detail : for a
foreigner this would be impossible : but, in accordance with
the point of view he would naturally take, he will direct his
eyes to those epochs which have had the most effectual
influence on the development of mankind : only so far as is
necessary for the comprehension of these, will he introduce
anything that precedes or comes after them.
There is an especial charm in following, century after century,
the history of the English nation, in considering the
antagonism of the elements out of which it is composed, and
its share in the fortunes and enterprises of that great community
of western nations to which it belongs ; but it will
be readily granted that no other period can be compared
in general importance with the epoch of those religious
and political wars which fill the sixteenth and seventeenth
centuries.
In the sixteenth century the part which England took in
the work of emancipating the world from the rule of the
western hierarchy decisively influenced not only its own constitution,
but also the success of the religious revolution
throughout Europe. In England the monarchy perfectly
understood its position in relation to this great change ;
while favouring the movement in its own interest, it nevertheless
contrived to maintain the old historical state of things
to a great extent ; nowhere have more of the institutions of
the Middle Ages been retained than in England ; nowhere
did the spiritual power link itself more closely with the
temporal. Here less depends on the conflict of doctrines,
for which Germany is the classic ground : the main interest
lies in the political transformation, accomplished amidst nlanifold
variations of opinions, tendencies, and events, and attended
at last by a war for the very existence of the nation.
For it was against England that the sacerdotal reaction
directed its main attack. To withstand it, the country was
forced to ally itself with the kindred elements on the Continent
: thc successful resistance of England was in turn of the
greatest service to them. The maintenance of Protestantism
in Western Europe, on the Continent as well as in Britain,
was effected by the united powers of both. To bring out
clearly this alternate action, it would not be advisable to lay
weight on every temporary foreign relation, on every step
of the home administration, and to search out men's personal
motives in them ; a shorter sketch may be best suited to
show the chief characters, as well as the main purport of
the events in their full light.
But then, through the connexion of England with Scotland,
and the accession of a new dynasty, a state of things ensued
under which the continued maintenance of the position taken
up in home and foreign politics was rendered doubtful. The
question arose whether the policy of England would not differ
from that of Great Britain and be compelled to give way to it.
The attempt to decide this question, and the reciprocal influence
of the newly allied countries, brought on conflicts at
homc which, though they in the main arose out of foreign
relations, yet for a long while threw those relations into the
background.
If we were required to express in the most general terms
the distinction between English and French policy in the
last two centuries, we might say that it consisted in this, that
the glory of their arms abroad lay nearest to the heart of
the French nation, and the legal settlement of their home
affairs to that of the English. How often have the French, in
b 2
viii PREFA CE t
PREFA CZ. ix
appearance at least, allowed themselves to be consoled for the
defects of the home administration by a great victory or an
advantageous peace ! And the English, from regard to constitutional
questions of apparently 'inferior importance, have
not seldom turned their eyes away from grievous perils which
hung over Europe.
The two great constitutional powers in England, the Crown
and the Parliament, dating back as they did to early times,
had often previously contended with each other, but had
harmoniously combined in the religious struggle, and had
both gained strength thereby ; but towards the middle of
the seventeenth century we see them first come into collision
over ecclesiastical regulations, and then engage in a war
for life and death respecting the constitution of the realm.
Elements originally separate unite in attacking the monarchy ;
meanwhile the old system breaks up, and energetic efforts are
made to found a new one on its ruins. But none of them
succeed; the deeply-felt need of a life regulated by law
and able to trust its own future is not satisfied; after long
storms men seek safety in a return to the old and approved
historic forms so characteristic of the German, and
especially of the English, race. But in this there is clearly
no solution of the original controversies, no reconciliation
of the conflicting elements : within narrower limits new discords
break out, which once more threaten a complete overthrow
: until, thanks to the indifference shown by England
to continental events, the most formidable dangers arise to
threaten the equilibrium of Europe, and even menace England
itself. These European emergencies coinciding with
the troubles at home bring about a new change of the old
forms in the Revolution of 1688, the main result of which is,
that the centre of gravity of public authority in England
shifts decisively to the parliamentary side. It was during
this same time that France had won military and political
superiority over all its neighbours on the mainland, and in
connexion with it had concentrated an almost absolute power
at home in the hands of the monarchy. England thus reorganised
now s,et itself to contest the political superiority of
France in a long and bloody war, which consequently became
a struggle between two rival forms of polity; and while the
first of these bore sway over the rest of Europe, the other
attained to con~plete realisation in its island-home, and called
forth at a later time manifold imitatiolls on the Continent
also, when the Continent was torn by civil strife. Between
these differing tendencies, these opposite poles, the life of
Europe has ever since vibrated from side to side.
When we contemplate the framework of the earth, those
